A simple Kubernetes controller that logs the lifecycle of pods. This is a learning exercise to get more experience with writing kubernetes controllers.

Setup instructions assume you already have access to a Kubernetes cluster. Minikube is an option if a an existing cluster is not available. https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/
